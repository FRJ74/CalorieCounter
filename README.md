# CalorieCounter

Sometimes when coding a web app, it's necessary to have the capability to accept input from a user. I'm builing a calorie counter project to learn how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update the interface to display the results.

In this practice project, I'll learn basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.
